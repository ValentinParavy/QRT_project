# QRT project: Can you guess the winner? 

https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/143 

The goal of this data challenge is to predict the outcome of football games, using real historical data at the player, team and league level. With Adriano Todisco (insert github link) we ranked 85 out of 776 on the private leaderboard, under the name of Ren√© Coty, a great man who marked French History. We present here the code that we used for our different submissions.
